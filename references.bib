The number of parameters has been reduced as much as possible, while attempting to preserve the representation of the physics which controls the energy and water budgets. We distinguish two main classes of parameters. The spatial distribution of primary parameters, i.e., the dominant types of soil and vegetation within each grid cell, can be specified from existing global datasets. The secondary parameters, describing the physical properties of each type of soil and vegetation, can be inferred from measurements or derived from numerical experiments. A single surface temperature is used to represent the surface energy balance of the land/cover system. The soil heat flux is linearly interpolated between its value over bare ground and a value of zero for complete shielding by the vegetation. The ground surface moisture equation includes the effect of gravity and the thermo-hydric coefficients of the equations have been either calculated or calibrated using textural dependent formulations. The calibration has been made using the results of a detailed soil model forced by prescribed atmospheric mean conditions. The results show that the coefficients of the surface soil moisture equation are greatly dependent upon the textural class of the soil, as well as upon its moisture content. The new scheme has been included in a one-dimensional model which allows a complete interaction between the surface and the atmosphere. Several simulations have been performed using data collected during HAPEX-MOBILHY. These first results show the ability of the parameterization to reproduce the components of the surface energy balance over a wide variety of surface conditions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The summertime improvement resulting from the operational implementation of a new surface modeling and assimilation strategy into the Canadian regional weather forecasting system is described in this study. The surface processes over land are represented in this system using the Interactions between Soil?Biosphere?Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface scheme. Surface variables, including soil moisture, are initialized using a sequential assimilation technique in which model errors of low-level air temperature and relative humidity are used to determine analysis increments of surface variables. It was found that the magnitude and nature of the analysis increments applied to the surface variables depended on the surface and meteorological conditions observed in each region. In regions characterized by weak meteorological activity (i.e., no clouds or precipitation), model errors of low-level air characteristics are more likely to be related to an incorrect representation of surface processes due to either erroneous initial conditions or inaccurate parameterizations in the land surface scheme. In other regions characterized by more frequent and more intense precipitation events, surface corrections are mainly associated with inaccurate atmospheric forcing. Objective evaluation against observations from radiosondes and surface stations showed that the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of near-surface air temperature and humidity is larger with the new surface system, in better agreement with observations. This type of improvement was found to extend higher up in the boundary layer (up to 700 hPa) where cold and humid biases were significantly reduced by introducing the new surface system. The model precipitation was also found to be significantly influenced by the new representation of surface fluxes. The problematic increase of a positive bias in precipitation with integration time was found to be significantly reduced with the new system, due to the warmer and drier boundary layer.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Since 12 January 2005, an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been used operationally at the Meteorological Service of Canada to provide the initial conditions for the medium-range forecasts of the ensemble prediction system. One issue in EnKF development is how to best account for model error. It is shown that in a perfect-model environment, without any model error or model error simulation, the EnKF spread remains representative of the ensemble mean error with respect to a truth integration. Consequently, the EnKF can be used to quantify the impact of the various error sources in a data-assimilation cycle on the quality of the ensemble mean. Using real rather than simulated observations, but still not simulating model error in any manner, the rms ensemble spread is found to be too small by approximately a factor of 2. It is then attempted to account for model error by using various combinations of the following four different approaches: (i) additive isotropic model error perturbations; (ii) different versions of the model for different ensemble members; (iii) stochastic perturbations to physical tendencies; and (iv) stochastic kinetic energy backscatter. The addition of isotropic model error perturbations is found to have the biggest impact.

	Abstract = {Abstract An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been implemented for atmospheric data assimilation. It assimilates observations from a fairly complete observational network with a forecast model that includes a standard operational set of physical parameterizations. To obtain reasonable results with a limited number of ensemble members, severe horizontal and vertical covariance localizations have been used. It is observed that the error growth in the data assimilation cycle is mainly due to model error. An isotropic parameterization, similar to the forecast-error parameterization in variational algorithms, is used to represent model error. After some adjustment, it is possible to obtain innovation statistics that agree with the ensemble-based estimate of the innovation amplitudes for winds and temperature. Currently, no model error is added for the humidity variable, and, consequently, the ensemble spread for humidity is too small. After about 5 days of cycling, fairly stable global filter statistics are obtained with no sign of filter divergence. The quality of the ensemble mean background field, as verified using radiosonde observations, is similar to that obtained using a 3D variational procedure. In part, this is likely due to the form chosen for the parameterized model error. Nevertheless, the degree of similarity is surprising given that the background-error statistics used by the two procedures are rather different, with generally larger background errors being used by the variational scheme. A set of 5-day integrations has been started from the ensemble of initial conditions provided by the EnKF. For the middle and lower troposphere, the growth rates of the perturbations are somewhat smaller than the growth rate of the actual ensemble mean error. For the upper levels, the perturbation patterns decay for about 3 days as a consequence of diffusive model dynamics. These decaying perturbations tend to severely underestimate the actual error that grows rapidly near the model top.},

For precipitation forecasts, all perturbation approaches improve ensemble reliability relative to the control CPEFS. Deterministic ensemble member forecast skill, verified against radiosonde observations, decreases when forecast perturbations are added, while ensemble mean forecasts remain similarly skillful to the control.},

	Abstract = {Abstract With many operational centers moving toward order 1-km-gridlength models for routine weather forecasting, this paper presents a systematic investigation of the properties of high-resolution versions of the Met Office Unified Model for short-range forecasting of convective rainfall events. The authors describe a suite of configurations of the Met Office Unified Model running with grid lengths of 12, 4, and 1 km and analyze results from these models for a number of convective cases from the summers of 2003, 2004, and 2005. The analysis includes subjective evaluation of the rainfall fields and comparisons of rainfall amounts, initiation, cell statistics, and a scale-selective verification technique. It is shown that the 4- and 1-km-gridlength models often give more realistic-looking precipitation fields because convection is represented explicitly rather than parameterized. However, the 4-km model representation suffers from large convective cells and delayed initiation because the grid length is too long to correctly reproduce the convection explicitly. These problems are not as evident in the 1-km model, although it does suffer from too numerous small cells in some situations. Both the 4- and 1-km models suffer from poor representation at the start of the forecast in the period when the high-resolution detail is spinning up from the lower-resolution (12 km) starting data used. A scale-selective precipitation verification technique implies that for later times in the forecasts (after the spinup period) the 1-km model performs better than the 12- and 4-km models for lower rainfall thresholds. For higher thresholds the 4-km model scores almost as well as the 1-km model, and both do better than the 12-km model.},

Second, WRF output was compared directly with output from current operational forecast models. Results indicate that human forecasts showed a small, but measurable, improvement when forecasters had access to the high-resolution WRF output and, in the mean, the WRF output received higher ratings than the operational Eta Model on subjective performance measures related to convective initiation, evolution, and mode.

Improving forecast uncertainty communication requires research-based knowledge that can inform decisions on what uncertainty information to communicate, when, and how to do so. To help build such knowledge, this article explores the public?s perspectives on everyday weather forecast uncertainty and uncertainty information using results from a nationwide survey. By contributing to the fundamental understanding of laypeople?s views on forecast uncertainty, the findings can inform both uncertainty communication and related research. The article uses empirical data from a nationwide survey of the U.S. public to investigate beliefs commonly held among meteorologists and to explore new topics. The results show that when given a deterministic temperature forecast, most respondents expected the temperature to fall within a range around the predicted value. In other words, most people inferred uncertainty into the deterministic forecast. People?s preferences for deterministic versus nondeterministic forecasts were examined in two situations; in both, a significant majority of respondents liked weather forecasts that expressed uncertainty, and many preferred such forecasts to single-valued forecasts. The article also discusses people?s confidence in different types of forecasts, their interpretations of the probability of precipitation forecasts, and their preferences for how forecast uncertainty is conveyed.

Many schemes have followed the approach of Kessler in which one moment of the hydrometeor size distribution, proportional to the mass content, is predicted. More recently, the two-moment method has been introduced in which both the mass and the total number concentration of the hydrometeor categories are independently predicted. In bulk schemes, the size spectrum of each hydrometeor category is often described by a three-parameter gamma distribution function, N(D) = N0Dαe??D. Two-moment schemes generally treat N0 and ? as prognostic parameters while holding αconstant. In this paper, the role of the spectral shape parameter, α, is investigated by examining its effects on sedimentation and microphysical growth rates. An approach is introduced for a two-moment scheme where αis allowed to vary diagnostically as a function of the mean-mass diameter. Comparisons are made between calculations using various bulk approaches?a one-moment, a two-moment, and a three-moment method?and an analytic bin model. It is found that the size-sorting mechanism, which exists in a bulk scheme when different fall velocities are applied to advect the different predicted moments, is significantly different amongst the schemes. The shape parameter plays an important role in determining the rate of size sorting.

The specific formulation of the modifications evolved from an effort to produce desired effects in numerical weather prediction while also rendering the scheme more faithful to observations and cloud-resolving modeling studies.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe use of ensembles in numerical weather prediction models is becoming an increasingly effective method of forecasting. Many studies have shown that using the mean of an ensemble as a deterministic solution produces the most accurate forecasts.

At synoptic scales, this appears to occur between 12- and 24-h forecast time, and on storm scales it may occur significantly faster due to stronger nonlinearity.

This paper will investigate the usefulness of the mean within a WRF Model utilizing an ensemble Kalman filter for severe convective events.To determine when the mean becomes unrealistic, the divergence of the mean of the ensemble (?mean?) and a deterministic forecast initialized from a set of mean initial conditions (?control?) are examined. It is found that significant divergence between the mean and control emerges no later than 6 h into a convective event.

To evaluate the capabilities of the system, retrospective short-range probabilistic storm-scale (convection allowing) ensemble analyses and forecasts are produced for the 27 April 2011 Alabama severe weather outbreak. Results indicate that the storm-scale ensembles are able to analyze the observed storms with strong low-level rotation at approximately the correct locations and to retain the supercell structures during the 0?1-h forecasts with reasonable accuracy. The system predicts the low-level mesocyclones of significant isolated tornadic supercells that align well with the locations of radar-derived rotation. For cases with multiple interacting storms in close proximity, the system tends to produce more variability in mesocyclone forecasts from one initialization time to the next until the observations show the dominance of one of the cells. The short-range ensemble probabilistic forecasts obtained from this continuous 5-min storm-scale 6-h-long update system demonstrate the potential of a frequently updated, high-resolution NWP system that could be used to extend severe weather warning lead times. This study also demonstrates the challenges associated with developing a WoF-type system.

	Abstract = {AbstractStorm-scale ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) studies routinely use methods to accelerate the spinup of convective structures when assimilating convective-scale radar observations. This typically involves adding coherent perturbations into analyses at regular intervals in regions where radar observations indicate convection is ongoing. Significant uncertainty remains as to the most effective use of these perturbations, including appropriate perturbation magnitudes, spatial scales, fields, and smoothing kernels, as well as flexible strategies that can be applied across a spectrum of convective events with negligible a priori tuning. Here, several idealized experiments were performed to elucidate the impact and sensitivity of adding coherent perturbations into storm-scale analyses of convection. Through the use of toy experiments, it is demonstrated that various factors exhibit substantial influence on the postsmoothed perturbation magnitudes, making tuning challenging. Several OSSEs were performed to document the impact of these perturbations on the analyses, particularly thermodynamic analyses within convection. The repeated addition of coherent perturbations produced temperature and moisture biases that are most pronounced in analyses of the surface cold pool and aloft near the tropopause, and eventually lead to biases in the dynamic fields. In an attempt to reduce these biases and make the noise procedure more adaptive, reflectivity innovations were used to restrict the addition of noise to areas where these innovations are large.

	Abstract = {AbstractDuring the spring 2011 season, a real-time continuously cycled ensemble data assimilation system using the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) coupled with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed toolkit provided initial and boundary conditions for deterministic convection-permitting forecasts, also using WRF, over the eastern two-thirds of the conterminous United States (CONUS). In this study the authors evaluate the mesoscale assimilation system and the convection-permitting forecasts, at 15- and 3-km grid spacing, respectively. Experiments employing different physics options within the continuously cycled ensemble data assimilation system are shown to lead to differences in the mean mesoscale analysis characteristics. Convection-permitting forecasts with a fixed model configuration are initialized from these physics-varied analyses, as well as control runs from 0.5$\,^{\circ}$Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis. Systematic bias in the analysis background influences the analysis fit to observations, and when this analysis initializes convection-permitting forecasts, the forecast skill is degraded as bias in the analysis background increases. Moreover, differences in mean error characteristics associated with each physical parameterization suite lead to unique errors of spatial, temporal, and intensity aspects of convection-permitting rainfall forecasts. Observation bias by platform type is also shown to impact the analysis quality.},

In this study the authors evaluate the mesoscale assimilation system and the convection-permitting forecasts, at 15- and 3-km grid spacing, respectively. Experiments employing different physics options within the continuously cycled ensemble data assimilation system are shown to lead to differences in the mean mesoscale analysis characteristics. Convection-permitting forecasts with a fixed model configuration are initialized from these physics-varied analyses, as well as control runs from 0.5$\,^{\circ}$Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis. Systematic bias in the analysis background influences the analysis fit to observations, and when this analysis initializes convection-permitting forecasts, the forecast skill is degraded as bias in the analysis background increases. Moreover, differences in mean error characteristics associated with each physical parameterization suite lead to unique errors of spatial, temporal, and intensity aspects of convection-permitting rainfall forecasts. Observation bias by platform type is also shown to impact the analysis quality.},

Perfect-model experiments are used to investigate the limited predictability in precipitation forecasts by comparing analysis schemes that resolve different length scales.

The high-resolution analysis leads to better forecasts for the first hour, but after 3 hours, the forecast quality of the schemes is indistinguishable. The more rapid error growth in forecasts from the high-resolution analysis appears to be associated with a limited predictability of the small scales, but also with gravity wave noise and spurious convective cells.

The evolving nonlinearity results in unrealistic behavior of the ensemble mean that significantly underestimates precipitation and wind speeds associated with the cyclones. Choosing a single ensemble member closest to the ensemble mean over the entire forecast window provides forecasts that are unable to produce the relatively small errors of the ensemble mean.

	Abstract = {AbstractPrevious research suggests that an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation and modeling system can produce accurate atmospheric analyses and forecasts at 30?50-km grid spacing. This study examines the ability of a mesoscale EnKF system using multiscale (36/12 km) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations to produce high-resolution, accurate, regional surface analyses, and 6-h forecasts. This study takes place over the complex terrain of the Pacific Northwest, where the small-scale features of the near-surface flow field make the region particularly attractive for testing an EnKF and its flow-dependent background error covariances. A variety of EnKF experiments are performed over a 5-week period to test the impact of decreasing the grid spacing from 36 to 12 km and to evaluate new approaches for dealing with representativeness error, lack of surface background variance, and low-level bias. All verification in this study is performed with independent, unassimilated observations.Significant surface analysis and 6-h forecast improvements are found when EnKF grid spacing is reduced from 36 to 12 km. Forecast improvements appear to be a consequence of increased resolution during model integration, whereas analysis improvements also benefit from high-resolution ensemble covariances during data assimilation. On the 12-km domain, additional analysis improvements are found by reducing observation error variance in order to address representativeness error. Removing model surface biases prior to assimilation significantly enhances the analysis. Inflating surface wind and temperature background error variance has large impacts on analyses, but only produces small improvements in analysis RMS errors. Both surface and upper-air 6-h forecasts are nearly unchanged in the 12-km experiments. Last, 12-km WRF EnKF surface analyses and 6-h forecasts are shown to generally outperform those of the Global Forecast System (GFS), North American Model (NAM), and the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) by about 10{\%}?30{\%}, although these improvements do not extend above the surface. Based on these results, future improvements in multiscale EnKF are suggested.},

	Abstract = {AbstractA tropical cyclone (TC) circulation Tracking Radar Echo by Correlation technique (T-TREC) developed recently is applied to derive horizontal winds from single Doppler radar reflectivity Z data (combined with radial velocity Vr data when available). The typically much longer maximum range of Z observations compared to Vr data allows for much larger spatial coverage of the T-TREC-retrieved winds (VTREC) when a TC first enters the maximum range of a coastal radar. Retrieved using data from more than one scan volume, the T-TREC winds also contain valuable cross-beam wind information. The VTREC or Vr data at 30-min intervals are assimilated into the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model at 3-km grid spacing using an ensemble Kalman filter, over a 2-h window shortly after Typhoon Jangmi (2008) entered the Vr coverage area of an operational weather radar of Taiwan. The assimilation of VTREC data produces analyses of the typhoon structure and intensity that more closely match observations than analyses produced using Vr data or the reference Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis. Subsequent 28-h forecasts of intensity, track, structure, and precipitation are also improved by assimilating VTREC data. Further sensitivity experiments show that assimilation of VTREC data can build up a reasonably strong vortex in 1 h, while a longer assimilation period is required to spin up the vortex when assimilating Vr. Although the difference between assimilating VTREC and Vr is smaller when the assimilation window is longer, the improvement from assimilating VTREC is still evident. Assimilating Z data in addition to Vr or VTREC results in little further improvement.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The McGill University radar data assimilation system is used to initialize a convective storm at high resolution (1 km) from single?Doppler radar observations. In this study, the background term in the assimilation system is improved. Specifically, by assuming the correlation of the errors of the control variables to be isotropic and homogeneous, the background error covariance matrix is modeled by a recursive filter. In addition, a 3-h-prior high-resolution model forecast is used as the background field. The analysis fields from the assimilation system successfully trigger the convective storms in the radar-observed regions from a single assimilation window. Without data assimilation, the modeled storms did not occur at the right time and place. To account for the rapid evolution of the convective storms and to correct the forecast errors with time, a cycling process is applied for a very short-term forecast. It is found that the first assimilation window can maintain the prediction of the storms for less than 1 h. The cycling process helps to maintain the intensity of the storm cells for a longer period of time. However, a comparison of radar observations with the 90-min simulation indicates an error in the position of the convective cells. The error of the radial component of the wind field between the observation and the simulation is larger at the upper levels. A wavelet analysis between the observation and simulated reflectivities indicates that the forecast is able to adequately predict the convective scale (?10?20 km) during the first 20 min, whereas the simulation has more predictability at the longer scale (>30 km) beyond 20 min.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The problem of sidelobe contamination in a bistatic network is explored. The McGill bistatic network consists of one S-band Doppler radar and two low-gain passive receivers at remote sites. Operational experience with the bistatic network indicated many cases in which sidelobe contamination seemed nonnegligible. To confirm these findings a sidelobe simulation model was constructed. Comparison between simulations and actual data showed a good reproduction of the observed effect, with differences explained by uncertainties in both transmitter and receiver antenna patterns. It is also shown that this effect may have damaging consequences in Doppler fields in both convective and stratiform precipitation events. An index of contamination is introduced to detect areas of low-quality data.},

@article{wurman:1993,
	Abstract = {Abstract A multiple-Doppler radar network can be constructed using only one, traditional, transmitting pencil-beam radar and one or more passive, low-gain, nontransmitting receivers at remote sites. Radiation scattered from the pencil beam of the transmitting radar as it penetrates weather targets can be detected at the receive-only sites as well as at the active transmitter. The Doppler shifts of the radiation received at all the sites can be used to construct two- and three-dimensional wind fields in a manner similar to that used with traditional Doppler radar networks. There are unique scientific advantages to a bistatic multiple-Doppler network: 1) all radial velocity measurements from individual resolution volumes are collected simultaneously since there is only one source of radiation; 2) the intensity of the obliquely scattered radiation can be compared to Rayleigh scattering predictions and used for hail detection; 3) rapid scanning of localized weather phenomena can be aided by elimination of the need to scan with multiple radars. This type of multiple-Doppler radar network also has significant economic advantages. Passive sites contain no high-voltage transmitting equipment or large rotating antennas. They require no operators and much less maintenance. We estimate initial investment costs, and subsequent operational and maintenance costs are less than one-thirtieth that of conventional radars. There are shortcomings particular to these types of networks: 1) passive, low-gain, receiving sites are more sensitive to contamination from transmitter sidelobes and to secondary scattering from weather echoes; 2) low-gain receiving sites are less sensitive to weak weather echoes; 3) Cartesian (u, v, w) wind fields derived from bistatic network data exhibit about twice the expected error as those constructed from data from traditional monostatic networks containing equal numbers of radars. Multiple scattering and sidelobe contamination levels are acceptable in most situations and can be reduced with the use of higher-gain receiving antennas. The low sensitivity and higher errors of the bistatic networks can be ameliorated with the use of multiple passive sites, a practical solution due to their very low cost.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The lifetime of precipitation patterns in Eulerian and Lagrangian space derived from continental-scale radar images is used as a measure of predictability. A three-step procedure is proposed. First, the motion field of precipitation is determined by variational radar echo tracking. Second, radar reflectivity is advected by means of a modified semi-Lagrangian advection scheme assuming stationary motion. Third, the Eulerian and Lagrangian persistence forecasts are compared to observations to calculate the lifetime and other measures of predictability. The procedure is repeated with images that have been decomposed according to scales to describe the scale-dependence of predictability. The analysis has a threefold application: (i) determine the scale-dependence of predictability, (ii) set a standard against which the skill for quantitative precipitation forecasting by numerical modeling can be evaluated, and (iii) extend nowcasting by optimal extrapolation of radar precipitation patterns. The methodology can be applied to other field variables such as brightness temperatures of weather satellites imagery.},

	Abstract = {Doppler radar data are assimilated with an ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) in combination with a double-moment (DM) microphysics scheme in order to improve the analysis and forecast of microphysical states and precipitation structures within a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that passed over western Oklahoma on 8-9 May 2007. Reflectivity and radial velocity data from five operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) S-band radars as well as four experimental Collaborative and Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) X-band radars are assimilated over a 1-h period using either single-moment (SM) or DM microphysics schemes within the forecast ensemble. Three-hour deterministic forecasts are initialized from the final ensemble mean analyses using a SM or DM scheme, respectively. Polarimetric radar variables are simulated from the analyses and compared with polarimetric WSR-88D observations for verification. EnKF assimilation of radar data using a multimoment microphysics scheme for an MCS case has not previously been documented in the literature. The use of DM microphysics during data assimilation improves simulated polarimetric variables through differentiation of particle size distributions (PSDs) within the stratiform and convective regions. The DM forecast initiated from the DM analysis shows significant qualitative improvement over the assimilation and forecast using SM microphysics in terms of the location and structure of the MCS precipitation. Quantitative precipitation forecasting skills are also improved in the DM forecast. Better handling of the PSDs by the DM scheme is believed to be responsible for the improved prediction of the surface cold pool, a stronger leading convective line, and improved areal extent of stratiform precipitation. {$[$}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR{$]$}; Copyright of Monthly Weather Review is the property of American Meteorological Society and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	Abstract = {Several observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) were performed to assess the impact of covariance localization of radar data on ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) analyses of a developing convective system. Simulated Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) observations were extracted from a truth simulation and assimilated into experiments with localization cutoff choices of 6, 12, and 18 km in the horizontal and 3, 6, and 12 km in the vertical. Overall, increasing the horizontal localization and decreasing the vertical localization produced analyses with the smallest RMSE for most of the state variables. The convective mode of the analyzed system had an impact on the localization results. During cell mergers, larger horizontal localization improved the results. Prior state correlations between the observations and state variables were used to construct reverse cumulative density functions (RCDFs) to identify the correlation length scales for various observation-state pairs. The OSSE with the smallest RMSE employed localization cutoff values that were similar to the horizontal and vertical length scales of the prior state correlations, especially for observation-state correlations above 0.6. Vertical correlations were restricted to state points closer to the observations than in the horizontal, as determined by the RCDFs. Further, the microphysical state variables were correlated with the reflectivity observations on smaller scales than the three-dimensional wind field and radial velocity observations. The ramifications of these findings on localization choices in convective-scale EnKF experiments that assimilate radar data are discussed. {$[$}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR{$]$}; Copyright of Monthly Weather Review is the property of American Meteorological Society and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	Abstract = {Analytical expressions for the power spectral density (PSD) are often useful in stochastic lithography simulation and the metrology of roughness. Using a common stretched exponential correlation function with three parameters (standard deviation, correlation length, and roughness exponent), the PSD can be computed as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. For the special cases of roughness exponent equal to 0.5 and 1, the PSD can be computed analytically for one, two, and three dimensions. In this paper, the analytical results of these calculations are given. The resulting equations can be used when modeling rough lines, surfaces, or volumes.},

	Abstract = {A variational method for the retrieval of the 3D wind field from bistatic multiple-Doppler radar network data is developed, and its performance is evaluated. This bistatic network consists of one S-band weather radar and two passive low-gain receivers at remote sites. To allow for measurement error, the method uses the Doppler velocities of the three receivers as weak constraints and uses the continuity equation as a strong constraint in a cost function in which the two horizontal wind components are the control variables. Improvements are brought to the classical upward integration of the continuity equation, using a weighted combination of upward and downward integrations and its adjoint. A unique characteristic of a bistatic network is that all Doppler velocity measurements from individual resolution volumes are collected simultaneously, which minimizes the errors on the vertical wind component arising from the local evolution of the airflow. However, the time required to sample a complete weather volume with a Doppler radar (typically 5 min) represents another source of error that must be accounted for. Consequently, linear time interpolation of the measurements to a single reference time is used. Finally, evaluation of the volume scanning strategy for aviation weather services shows that two retrieval modes can be processed in parallel, using the McGill University radar scanning strategy: a \&{\#}8220;fast\&{\#}8221; mode that provides the 3D wind field below 3-km height every 2.5 min and a \&{\#}8220;standard\&{\#}8221; mode that provides the 3D wind field for the full volume every 5 min. },

	Abstract = {An analysis is developed to initialize a cloud-resolving model from an explicit structure of a precipitating convective system derived from multiple-Doppler radar observations. The different fields of the model prognostic variables that compose the initial state of the simulation are estimated or retrieved using a 4DVAR assimilation method in which the model is used as a weak constraint using two time level observations. This allows for the retrieval of physical fields consistent with the observations and the equations of the model.This method is applied on a midlatitude summer storm sampled by the McGill bistatic Doppler radar network that occurred on 2 August 1997. During the 30-min-forward simulation, the model succeeds in representing the observed features of the three main cells that compose the storm in terms of precipitation distribution and evolution of the convective activity. After this period, the model produces less stratiform precipitations. Comparisons with a Lagrangian persistency prediction are performed and show a notable improvement in the short-term forecast. },

	Abstract = {A 3D wind analysis based on single-Doppler data is proposed using mass conservation and assuming a linear horizontal wind field, which is constant in a moving reference frame. Data over an assimilation period that includes several volume scans are employed, allowing the retrieval of the full linear wind field, including vorticity. The method proposed here can be considered an extension of the volume velocity processing (VVP) procedure. The robustness of the method is examined in detail and a criterion on the condition number is obtained. The method is tested in the context of synthetic data, which respect the simplified model assumptions. Simulated data from a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model are used to assess the impact of errors in the simplified model. The results indicate that 1) the analysis improves as the assimilation period is lengthened up to 1 h, 2) the best results are obtained when the radar is surrounded by precipitation and is in the middle of the analysis domain, and 3) vorticity is the most sensitive parameter. The addition of a vertical smoothing constraint is shown to be beneficial for the minimization and improves the results. },

The results of polarimetric echo classification have been integrated into the study to investigate the performance of radar rainfall estimation contingent on hydrometeor type. A new method for rainfall estimation that capitalizes on the results of polarimetric echo classification (EC method) is suggested. According to the EC method, polarimetric rainfall relations are utilized if the radar resolution volume is filled with rain (or rain and hail), and multiple R(Z) relations are used for different types of frozen hydrometeors. The intercept parameters in the R(Z) relations for each class are determined empirically from comparisons with gauges. It is shown that the EC method exhibits better performance than the conventional WSR-88D algorithm with a reduction by a factor of 1.5\&{\#}8211;2 in the rms error of 1-h rainfall estimates up to distances of 150 km from the radar. },

It is an integral part of the automatic data processing system, and is designed to operate with a minimum of manual supervision. The analysis method, based mainly on the method of Bergth\'orssen and D\"o\"oos, is essentially a method of applying corrections to a first guess field. The corrections are determined from a comparison of the data with the interpolated value of the guess field at the observation point. For the analysis of the heights of a pressure surface the reported wind is taken into account in determining the lateral gradient of the correction to be applied. A series of scans of the field is made, each scan consisting of application of corrections on a smaller lateral scale than during the previous scan.The analysis system is very flexible, and has been used to analyze many different types of variables. An example of horizontal divergence computed from a direct wind analysis is shown. },

	Abstract = {The contribution of various physical sources of uncertainty affecting radar rainfall estimates at the ground is quantified toward deriving and understanding the error covariance matrix of these estimates. The focus here is on stratiform precipitation at a resolution of 15 km, which is most relevant for data assimilation onto mesoscale numerical models. In the characterization of the error structure, the following contributions are considered: (i) the individual effect of the range-dependent error (associated with beam broadening and increasing height of radar measurements with range), (ii) the error associated with the transformation from reflectivity to rain rate due to the variability of drop size distributions, and (iii) the interaction of the first two, that is, the term resulting from the cross correlation between the effects of the range-dependent error and the uncertainty related to the variability of drop size distributions (DSDs).For this purpose a large database of S-band radar observations at short range (where reflectivity near the ground is measured and the beam is narrow) is used to characterize the range-dependent error within a simulation framework, and disdrometric measurements collocated with the radar data are used to assess the impact of the variability of DSDs. It is noted that these two sources of error are well correlated in the vicinity of the melting layer as result of the physical processes that determine the density of snow (e.g., riming), which affect both the DSD variability and the vertical profile of reflectivity. },

	Abstract = {The contribution of various physical sources of uncertainty affecting radar rainfall estimates at the ground has been recently quantified at a resolution typically used in schemes assimilating rainfall at the ground onto mesoscale models. Here, the contribution of the two most important sources of uncertainty at nonattenuating wavelengths (the range-dependent error and the uncertainty due to the Z\&{\#}8211;R transformation) and their interaction are studied as a function of the resolution of radar observations.The analysis is carried out using a large dataset of collocated reflectivity profiles from the McGill S-band radar and disdrometric measurements obtained in stratiform rainfall at resolutions of 1 {$\times$} 1, 5 {$\times$} 5, and 15 {$\times$} 15 km2. Results show that the errors affecting radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) have a strong dependence with range, and that their structure is scale dependent. At the analyzed resolutions, QPE errors are significantly correlated in time and over several grid points. },

A diagnostic technique for the presence of supercooled cloud in the presence of snow is presented here. The data required are single-Doppler observations of reflectivity and radial velocity as well as a nearby sounding of temperature. From these data, the 3D wind field is retrieved by a variational method. From the retrieved vertical motion, the supercooled water is derived from the steady-state balance relation between snow content and cloud liquid water. The method is tested with a kinematic model that includes the main microphysical processes expected to occur in stratiform subfreezing conditions. A comparison between aircraft in situ measurements of supercooled water content and the diagnosed as well as model-generated values shows good agreement. },

	Abstract = {The equilibrium shape of raindrops has been determined from Laplace's equation using an internal hydrostatic pressure with an external aerodynamic pressure based on measurements for a sphere but adjusted for the effect of distortion. The drop shape was calculated by integration from the upper pole with the initial curvature determined by iteration on the drop volume. The shape was closed at the lower pole by adjusting either the pressure drag or the drop weight to achieve an overall force balance. Model results provide bounds on the axis ratio of raindrops with an uncertainty of about 1{\%} and very good agreement with extensive wind tunnel measurements for moderate to large water drops. The model yields the peculiar asymmetric shape of raindrops: a singly curved surface with a flattened base and a maximum curvature just below the major axis. A close match was found between model shapes and profiles obtained from photos of water drops for diameters up to 5 mm. Coefficients are provided for computing raindrop shape as a cosine series distortion on a sphere. In contrast to earlier models of raindrop shape for the oblate spheroid response to gravity (Green, Beard) or the perturbation response to the aerodynamic pressure for a sphere (Imai, Savic, Pruppacher and Pitter), the present model provides the appropriate large amplitude response to both the hydrostatic and aerodynamic pressures modified for distortion. In addition, the new model can be readily extended to include other pressures such as an electric stress. },

The measurements were made simultaneously, with the radar pulse volume situated 120 m above the ground-based disdrometer. Despite the difference in size of the respective sampling volumes, agreement between the radar and disdrometer measurements was generally good. The radar estimates of ZH exceeded the disdrometer estimates by 1.6 dB on average, well within the expected experimental error. The disdrometer estimates of ZDR exceeded the radar estimates by 0.3 dB on average. This was somewhat larger than could be accounted for by experimental error, and further analysis suggested that some modification to the theoretical ratios of horizontal and vertical backscattering cross sections was required, for drops of diameter <2.5 mm. An empirical modification to these ratios enabled the difference to be reduced to 0.15 dB on average. },

	Abstract = {Disdrometric measurements are affected by the spurious variability due to drop sorting, small sampling volume, and instrumental noise. As a result, analysis methods that use least squares regression to derive rainfall rate\&{\#}8211;radar reflectivity (R\&{\#}8211;Z) relationships or studies of drop size distributions can lead to erroneous conclusions. This paper explores the importance of this variability and develops a new approach, referred to as the sequential intensity filtering technique (SIFT), that minimizes the effect of the spurious variability on disdrometric data. A simple correction for drop sorting in stratiform rain illustrates that it generates a significant amount of spurious variability and is prominent in small drops. SIFT filters out this spurious variability while maintaining the physical variability, as evidenced by stable R\&{\#}8211;Z relationships that are independent of averaging size and by a drastic decrease of the scatter in R\&{\#}8211;Z plots. The presence of scatter causes various regression methods to yield different best-fitted R\&{\#}8211;Z equations, depending on whether the errors on R or Z are minimized. The weighted total least squares (WTLS) solves this problem by taking into account errors in both R and Z and provides the appropriate coefficient and exponent of Z = aRb. For example, with a simple R versus Z least squares regression, there is an average fractional difference in a and b of Z = aRb of 17{\%} and 14{\%}, respectively, when compared with those derived using WTLS. With Z versus R regression, the average fractional difference in a and b is 19{\%} and 12{\%}, respectively. This uncertainty in the R\&{\#}8211;Z parameters may explain 40{\%} of the \&{\#}8220;natural variability\&{\#}8221; claimed in the literature but becomes negligible after applying SIFT, regardless of the regression methods used. },

	Abstract = {The oscillations of moderate to large raindrops are investigated using a seven-story fall column with shape data obtained from multiple-strobe photographs. Measurements are made at a fall distance of 25 m for drops of D = 2.5-, 2.9-, 3.6-, and 4.0-mm diameter, with additional measurements at intermediate distances to assess the role of aerodynamic feedback as the source of drop oscillations. Oscillations, initiated by the drop generator, are found to decay during the first few meters of fall and then increase to where the drops attained terminal speed near 10 m. Throughout the lower half of the fall column, the oscillation amplitudes are essentially constant. These apparently steady-state oscillations are attributed to resonance with vortex shedding. For D = 2.5 and 3.6 mm, the mean axis ratio is near the theoretical equilibrium value, a result consistent with axisymmetric (oblate/prolate mode) oscillations at the fundamental frequency. For D = 2.9 and 4.0 mm, however, the mean axis ratio is larger than the theoretical equilibrium value by 0.01 to 0.03, a characteristic of transverse mode oscillations. Comparison with previous axis ratio and vortex-shedding measurements suggests that the oscillation modes of raindrops are sensitive to initial conditions, but because of the prevalence of off-center drop collisions, the predominant steady-state response in rain is expected to be transverse mode oscillations. A simple formula is obtained from laboratory and field measurements to account for the generally higher average axis ratio of raindrops having transverse mode oscillations. In the application to light to heavy rainfall, the ensemble mean axis ratios for raindrop sizes of D = 1.5\&{\#}8211;4.0 mm are shifted above equilibrium values by 0.01\&{\#}8211;0.04, as a result of steady-state transverse mode oscillations maintained intrinsically by vortex shedding. Compared to the previous axis ratio formula based on wind tunnel measurements, the increased axis ratios for oscillating raindrops amount to a reduction of 0.1\&{\#}8211;0.4 dB in radar differential reflectivity ZDR, and an increase of about 0.5 mm for a reflectivity-weighted mean drop size of less than about 3 mm. },

	Abstract = {Polarization radar techniques essentially rely on detecting the oblateness of raindrops to provide a measure of mean raindrop size and then using this information to give a better estimate of rainfall rate R than is available from radar reflectivity Z alone. To derive rainfall rates from these new parameters such as differential reflectivity ZDR and specific differential phase shift KDP and to gauge their performance, it is necessary to know the range of naturally occurring raindrop size spectra. A three parameter gamma function is in widespread use, with the three variables No, Do, and \&{\#}956; providing a measure of drop concentration, mean size, and spectral shape, respectively. It has become standard practice to derive the range of these three variables in rain by comparing the 69 published values of the constants a and b in the empirical relationships Z = aRb with the values of a and b obtained when R and Z are derived by integrating the appropriately weighted gamma function. The relationships in common use both for inferring R from Z, ZDR, and KDP, and for developing attenuation correction routines have been derived from a best fit through the values obtained by cycling over these predicted ranges of No, Do, and \&{\#}956;. It is pointed out that this derivation of the predicted range of No, Do, and \&{\#}956; arises using a flawed logic for a particular nonnormalized form of the gamma function, and it is shown that the predicted ranges give rise to some very unrealistic drop spectra, including many with high rainfall and very small drop sizes. It is suggested that attenuation correction routines relying on differential phase may be suspect and the commonly used relationships between rainfall rate and Z, ZDR, and KDP need to be reexamined. When more realistic drop shapes are also used, it may be that published relationships for deriving R from Z and ZDR are in error by over a factor of 2; a new equation is proposed that, in the absence of hail and attenuation, should yield values of R accurate to 25{\%}, provided that ZDR can be estimated to 0.2 dB and Z is calibrated to 1 dB. Relationships of the form R = aKbDP, with b = 1.15, are in widespread use, but more realistic drop spectra and drop shapes yield a value of b closer to 1.4, similar to the exponent in Z\&{\#}8211;R relationships. In accord, although KDP has the advantage of insensitivity to hail, it may have the same sensitivity to variations in drop spectra as Z does. In addition, the higher value of the exponent b implies that the proposed use of the total phase shift to give the path-integrated total rainfall is also questionable. However, the consistency of Z, ZDR, and KDP in rain can be used to provide absolute calibration of Z to 0.5 dB (12{\%}), and when it fails it indicates that hail is present, in which case a relationship of the form KDP = aR1.4 should be used. The technique should work at S, C, and X band, but, in all cases, paths should be chosen so that the total phase shift is not large enough to introduce significant attenuation of Z and ZDR. },

	Abstract = {Procedures for the estimation and correction of advection effects with single and multiple conventional and Doppler radars are developed. In the case of scalars or Cartesian vectors, the essence of the method is finding a moving frame of reference where (in the least-square sense) the observations are as stationary as possible. It is shown that this is quite different from the more traditional correlation techniques. In the case of non-Cartesian vectors (e.g., radial velocities from Doppler radars), very different criteria are derived. For a single Doppler radar, we look for a frame of reference where \&{\#}8747;{$[$}\&{\#}8706;2/\&{\#}8706;t2(vrr){$]$}2 is a minimum. Here vr is the radial velocity, t is time and r is the distance of the observed point from the radar. In the multiple Doppler case, it is shown that in a frame of reference moving with the advection speed, \&{\#}8747;{$[$}\&{\#}8706;/\&{\#}8706;t(vr(1)r(1)) \&{\#}8722; \&{\#}8706;/\&{\#}8706;t(vr(2)r(2)){$]$}2 is a minimum. Here superscripts (1) and (2) refer to radars (1) and (2), respectively. For scalars (such as radar reflectivities) or Cartesian vectors, the correction for advection is trivial; one merely redefines the observations in the new frame. It is shown that in general, this correction, when applied to radial velocities, is wrong. The appropriate correction procedures are derived. Using scale analysis, error estimates with and without the correction procedures are derived. Experiments with dual-Doppler radar data of the optically clear boundary layer demonstrate that for that case it is possible to estimate advection velocities from the data. When a correction procedure is applied, the horizontal velocities, as well as the derived vertical motions, display improved temporal correlation between scans. },

	Abstract = {An algorithm is proposed, whereby the combined use of the equations of cloud dynamics, and the observed wind, will permit a unique determination of the density and pressure fluctuations. The algorithm has several unique features. First, it involves the use of only the momentum equations without resorting to any thermodynamical (microphysical) parameterizations. Second, there is no need to make any artificial assumptions about the boundary conditions. Instead, the algorithm determines (from wind observations) its own optimal boundary conditions. This latter feature is crucial for severe storm observations where very often the boundary conditions are not those of the larger scale environment.The viability of the method is tested with data generated by a numerical model. From these data the wind and its time derivative are estimated and used to calculate the density and pressure fluctuations. These calculations are then compared to the originally given density and pressure. The sensitivity of the method to various observational errors is assessed by inserting realistically simulated errors into the \&{\#}8220;observed\&{\#}8221; kinematics. The principal findings are as follows: 1) good results can be obtained, if the filtering (noise removal) technique takes into account subgrid-scale processes; 2) at least for some applications, doubt is cast on the validity of the local steady-state hypothesis, which is now commonly used. It is argued, nevertheless, that the nonsteadiness can be readily evaluated from observations. },

	Abstract = {The feasibility of using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to retrieve the wind and temperature fields in an isolated convective storm has been tested by applying the technique to observations of the 17 May 1981 Arcadia, Oklahoma, tornadic supercell. Radial-velocity and reflectivity observations from a single radar were assimilated into a nonhydrostatic, anelastic numerical model initialized with an idealized (horizontally homogeneous) base state. The assimilation results were compared to observations from another Doppler radar, the results of dual-Doppler wind syntheses, and in situ measurements from an instrumented tower. Observation errors make it more difficult to assess EnKF performance than in previous storm-scale EnKF experiments that employed synthetic observations and a perfect model; nevertheless, the comparisons in this case indicate that the locations of the main updraft and mesocyclone in the Arcadia storm were determined rather accurately, especially at midlevels. The magnitudes of vertical velocity and vertical vorticity in these features are similar to those in the dual-Doppler analyses, except that the low-level updraft is stronger in the EnKF analyses than in the dual-Doppler analyses.Several assimilation-scheme parameters are adjustable, including the method of initializing the ensemble, the inflation factor applied to perturbations, the magnitude of the assumed observation-error variance, and the degree of localization of the filter. In the Arcadia storm experiments, in which observations of a mature storm were assimilated over a relatively short (47 min) period, the results depended most on the ensemble-initialization method.In the data assimilation experiments, too much northerly storm-relative outflow along the south side of the low-level cold pool eventually developed during the assimilation period. Assimilation of Doppler observations did little to correct temperature errors near the surface in the cold pool. Both observational limitations (poor spatial resolution in the radar data near the ground) and model errors (coarse resolution and uncertainties in the parameterizations of moist processes) probably contributed to poor low-level temperature analyses in these experiments. },

With a few exceptions, the analysis system ran reliably over the 6-month period of the project, providing wind fields every 10 min. Described herein is the performance of the system in tracking a number of different phenomena, including sea breezes, a southerly change, and the low-level convergence associated with a severe tornadic hailstorm.

	Abstract = {A four-dimensional variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS) has been developed and implemented at a weather forecast office to produce real-time boundary layer wind and temperature analyses using WSR-88D radar data. This paper describes significant changes made to convert VDRAS from a research tool to a real-time analysis system and presents results of low-level wind and temperature analysis using operational radar data. In order to produce continuous analyses with time, VDRAS was implemented with a cycling procedure, in which the analysis from the previous cycle is used as a first guess and background for the next cycle. Other enhancements in this real-time system include direct assimilation of data on constant elevation angle levels, addition of mesonet observations, inclusion of an analysis background term, and continuous updating of lateral boundary conditions. An observed case of a line of storms and strong outflow is used to examine the performance of the real-time analysis system and its sensitivity to various system changes. The quality of the analysis for this case is examined by comparing the subsequent 90-min forecast with the observed radial velocity. It is shown that the forecast initialized using the VDRAS analysis outperforms persistence and a forecast using a mesoscale analysis. The accuracy of the retrieved wind in six convective cases is also verified against automated weather reports from commercial aircraft data. The verification shows an average difference of 3.3 m s\&{\#}8722;1 over these six cases. },

	Abstract = {A temporal interpolation is required for three-dimensional Doppler wind analysis when the precise measurement time is counted for each radar beam position. The time interpolation is traditionally done by a linear scheme either in the measurement space or in the analysis space. Because a volume scan often takes 5\&{\#}8211;10 min, the linear time interpolation is not accurate enough to capture the rapidly changing winds associated with a fast-moving and fast-growing storm. Performing the linear interpolation in a frame moving with the storm can reduce the error, but the analyzed wind field is traditionally assumed to be stationary in the moving frame. The stationary assumption simplifies the computation but ignores the time variation of the true wind field in the moving frame. By incorporating a linear time interpolation into the moving frame wind analysis, an improved scheme is developed. The merits of the new scheme are demonstrated by idealized examples and numerical experiments with simulated radar observations. The new scheme is also applied to real radar data for a supercell storm. },

	Abstract = {A new three-dimensional single-Doppler velocity retrieval is introduced and tested with reflectivity and radial velocity data gathered during the Phoenix II field program near Boulder, Colorado. This retrieval is based on reflectivity conservation (with provision for raindrop fall speed), the incompressibility condition, and a temporal constraint on the velocity field. Two temporal constraints are considered: velocity stationarity and Taylor's frozen turbulence approximation (velocity stationarity in a moving reference frame). It is demonstrated that either of these temporal constraints can be used to derive a second conserved scalar from the original conserved scalar (reflectivity). This two-scalar system is, in general, overdetermined, but a least-squares formulation reduces the problem to a Poisson equation for a pseudostreamfunction. The requisite boundary conditions arise naturally from the least-squares formulation and require only single-Doppler measurements for their evaluation. The new retrieval is tested with Phoenix II data for an optically clear convective planetary boundary layer (22 June 1984) and for a moderate reflectivity microburst (31 May 1984). The input data consist of three consecutive volume scans of radial velocity and reflectivity data from an X-band Doppler radar (NOAA radar C). To validate the retrievals, the retrieved winds are projected into the direction of a second Doppler radar (NOAA radar D) and a direct comparison made with the observed radial winds of that second radar. Experiments focus on data smoothing, optimal time constraints, and raindrop terminal velocity parameterizations. For an optimal treatment of these processes, good agreement is found between the observed and retrieved wind components in both datasets. },

	Abstract = {A single Doppler radar analysis scheme is developed, and three-dimensional wind fields am retrieved from single Doppler radar reflectivity and radial velocity fields. The retrieval is based on two assumptions: 1) the Lagrangian conservation of the radar reflectivity and 2) the steadiness of the eddy structures in the wind field. To least violate these assumptions, a moving frame of reference is found where (in the least square sense) the observations are as stationary as possible. Multiple time levels of observations are used to avoid ill-conditioned computations. The retrieval equations, that is, the conservation equation of reflectivity and the relationship between the total wind and its radial component for several time levels, form a simple linear system. This linear system is overdetermined with respect to the three unknown Cartesian components u, v, and w of the vector wind. Thus u, v, and w are solved in the least square sense. Dual Doppler radar analyses are performed to provide verifications for the single-Doppler retrievals. The results show very good agreement between the wind fields from single-Doppler retrievals and the dual-Doppler analyses. The important findings from various experiments include that 1) the weighting of each term in the cost function is crucial to the retrieval accuracy; 2) performing the retrievals in the moving frame improves the results significantly; and 3) proper filtering in space and time can reduce errors in retrieved wind fields. Two independent cases are studied to test the robustness of the scheme. },

	Abstract = {The moving-frame single-Doppler radar wind retrieval technique is investigated using field experimental data observed during the 1987 Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiment intensive observation period 2. Emphasis is placed on studying the impact of the geometric position of the radar in relation to the quality of the retrievals. Experiments show that this technique is capable of recovering the missing cross-beam wind components, but their magnitude is always underestimated. As a consequence, when the unobserved tangential components are smaller than the observable radial components, the best results are produced. By contrast, if the unknown cross-beam winds considerably exceed the radial winds because of a disadvantageous relationship to the radar observation site, the retrievals become less reliable. However, even without a priori knowledge of the true flow structure, which is always the case in reality, this single-Doppler retrieval scheme demonstrates its ability to distinguish which component (radial or azimuthal) is greater. In other words, when the tangential component completely dominates the radial winds, this message can be correctly delivered through the retrieval algorithm to alert the users so that the radar data and these single-Doppler-retrieved results will be interpreted and used with caution. },

	Abstract = {The authors present herein an analysis of a single-Doppler velocity retrieval (SDVR) technique whereby the unobserved wind components are determined from single-Doppler radar data. The analysis is designed to provide information about the behavior and/or sensitivity of the SDVR scheme as a function of various internal and external parameters as well as about observational errors and weights. Results presented for retrieval of both the mean and local flow indicate that the SDVR breaks down if the reflectivity gradient vanishes or if a reflectivity isoline is locally perpendicular to the radar beam. In the absence of reflectivity or radial velocity errors, the mean flow solution is independent of the integration area, the radar location, the signal wavenumber, and the weights. Given perfect radial wind information, error in the reflectivity field degrades the solution. Contrary to the error-free solution, the solution with error depends on the integration area. Error statistics indicate that radial wind information alone is not sufficient to retrieve the local wind. Reduced error norms reveal that an optimal (i.e., reduced error norms) integration area exists that is dependent upon the length of time between radar volume scans, suggesting that the velocity field is not stationary (as was assumed) over these scans. },

	Abstract = {The variational Doppler radar analysis system developed in part I of this study is tested on a Florida airmass storm observed during the Convection and Precipitation/ Electrification Experiment. The 3D wind, temperature, and microphysical structure of this storm are obtained by minimizing the difference between the radar-observed radial velocities and rainwater mixing ratios (derived from reflectivity) and their model predictions. Retrieval experiments are carried out to assimilate information from one or two radars. The retrieved fields are compared with measurements of two aircraft penetrating the storm at different heights. The retrieved wind, thermodynamical, and microphysical fields indicate that the minimization converges to a solution consistent with the input velocity and rainwater fields. The primary difference between using single-Doppler and dual-Doppler information is the reduction of the peak strength of the storm on the order of 10{\%} when information from only one radar is provided. The comparison with aircraft data shows good agreement for the vertical velocity, buoyancy, and the water vapor mixing ratio in terms of the general structure and strength of the fields, but less agreement for the cloud water and rainwater field. The sensitivities of the retrieval system to the neglect of the time difference at each grid point in a radar volume and to the inclusion of the background information at the initial time of the assimilation period are examined. Both show rather sensitive response. The experiments also show that the microphysical retrieval is quite sensitive to the relation used to derive the rainwater mixing ratio from reflectivity observations. },

In the first part of this two-part study, the technique used in this analysis system is described and tested using data from a simulated warm rain convective storm. The analysis system applies the 4D variational data assimilation technique to a cloud-scale model with a warm rain parameterization scheme. The 3D wind, thermodynamical, and microphysical fields are determined by minimizing a cost function, defined by the difference between both radar observed radial velocities and reflectivities (or rainwater mixing ratio) and their model predictions. The adjoint of the numerical model is used to provide the sensitivity of the cost function with respect to the control variables. Experiments using data from a simulated convective storm demonstrated that the variational analysis system is able to retrieve the detailed structure of wind, thermodynamics, and microphysics using either dual-Doppler or single-Doppler information. However, less accurate velocity fields are obtained when single-Doppler data were used. In both cases, retrieving the temperature field is more difficult than the retrieval of the other fields. Results also show that assimilating the rainwater mixing ratio obtained from the reflectivity data results in a better performance of the retrieval procedure than directly assimilating the reflectivity. It is also found that the system is robust to variations in the Z\&{\#}8211;qr relation, but the microphysical retrieval is quite sensitive to parameters in the warm rain scheme. The technique is robust to random errors in radial velocity and calibration errors in reflectivity. },

	Abstract = {Observations of Doppler-resolved spectra of differential radar reflectivity provide estimates of particle shapes as a function of their terminal velocity, and they can be derived by having the antenna at a significant elevation angle. Turbulence tends to smear out the details of the actual spectra observed, but the difference in the mean values of velocity using horizontal and vertical polarizations, which the authors call the \&{\#}8220;differential Doppler velocity\&{\#}8221; (DDV), is unaffected. Larger raindrops fall faster and are oblate, so values of DDV are positive. If a gamma function is used for the raindrop size spectrum, then the observed DDV and ZDR correspond to particular values of median drop diameter D0 and the dispersion index m. The scaling parameter N0 is derived from Z. Estimates of m have a mean value of 5 but vary substantially. An error in rainfall rate of up to {$\pm$}15{\%} results if the rainfall rate is computed from Z and ZDR alone, and m is assumed constant at 5. An overestimation of more than 30{\%} occurs if m is assumed to be 0. DDV values in stratiform ice are slightly negative. The values in ice are explicable in terms of a mixture of slowly falling oblate crystals and faster-falling spherical aggregates. In the bright band, DDV is consistent with the coexistence of oblate snowflakes and faster-falling raindrops. },

The upgraded method uses an improved reflectivity advection equation that contains not only the advection terms but also the eddy diffusion terms. The test results show that (i) utilizing multiple-time-level data provides more information and, thus, increases the accuracy of the retrieval; (ii) the adjoint method can retrieve not only the time-mean (or running mean) velocity field but also the coefficients of horizontal and vertical eddy diffusion (retrieving the eddy coefficients improves the velocity retrieval); (iii) the retrieval is improved by judiciously setting the weights in the cost function and by spatial noise-filtering and temporal interpolation of the data; (iv) the retrieval is further improved when the observed radial wind (along the radar beam) is used. },

For the case of dry convection, a set of identical twin experiments shows that it is possible to construct the initial conditions for the temperature only moderately well from observations of one velocity component only. This behavior can be explained with an ill-posedness of the problem in absence of temperature information caused by the discrete representation of gradients. Small pieces of additional thermodynamic information improve the results noticeably. Contamination of the data with random error has little impact on the quality of the retrieved initial state, as long as there are enough data available. Phenomena not resolved by the data are not retrievable by the algorithm. For the case considered, the adjoint method proves to be a robust tool for data assimilation purposes, but it also leaves the question of how to avoid the ill-posedness open. },

	Abstract = {The adjoint method to retrieve the three-dimensional wind and thermodynamic fields is applied to single-Doppler observations of a gust front measured during the Phoenix II experiment. This method uses a fluid dynamics model and its adjoint, and combines the retrieval with data assimilation into the prediction model. The wind and thermodynamic variables are determined by minimizing the difference between the model solution and the observations. Experiments are conducted first with radial velocity alone and then with both radial velocity and reflectivity to examine the quality of the retrieval with respect to radar location, boundary conditions, length of assimilation, data filtering, smoothing enforced by penalty functions, and model accuracy. Verification of these experiments is provided by a dual-Doppler analysis.Test results show that the adjoint method is able to retrieve the wind and thermodynamic fields of the gust front. The retrieved horizontal wind agrees very well with the dual-Doppler analysis. This study also demonstrates that the adjoint method has the ability to resolve finescale features along the loading edge of the gust front. },

	Abstract = {Techniques for the absolute calibration of radar reflectivity Z and differential reflectivity ZDR measured with dual-polarization weather radars are examined herein. Calibration of Z is based on the idea of self-consistency among Z, ZDR, and the specific differential phase KDP in rain. Extensive spatial and temporal averaging is used to derive the average values of ZDR and KDP for each 1 dB step in Z. Such averaging substantially reduces the standard error of the KDP estimate so the technique can be used for a wide range of rain intensities, including light rain. In this paper, the performance of different consistency relations is analyzed and a new self-consistency methodology is suggested. The proposed scheme substantially reduces the impact of variability in the drop size distribution and raindrop shape on the quality of the Z calibration. The new calibration technique was tested on a large polarimetric dataset obtained during the Joint Polarization Experiment in Oklahoma and yielded an accuracy of Z calibration within 1 dB. Absolute calibration of ZDR is performed using solar measurements at orthogonal polarizations and polarimetric properties of natural targets like light rain and dry aggregated snow that are probed at high elevation angles. Because vertical sounding is prohibited for operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars because of mechanical constraints, the existing methodology for ZDR calibration is modified for nonzenith elevation angles. It is shown that the required 0.1\&{\#}8211;0.2-dB accuracy of the ZDR calibration is potentially achievable. },

	Abstract = {A simple adjoint method is developed for retrieving the time-mean winds from a number of consecutive single-Doppler measurements. The method assumes the Lagrangian conservation of reflectivity. Previous methods based on the same advection equation have to deal with problems of nonuniqueness, singularities, or both. These two problems are eliminated by using observations over multiple time levels. The method is tested on artificial data and the results show that using data over multiple time levels not only provides more information and increases the accuracy of the retrieval but also makes the method less sensitive to errors in the observed reflectivity field and errors in the model equation due to the assumed Lagrangian conservation of reflectivity. Because the control equation and its adjoint equation are very simple, the computational cost is very small. It is also found that incorporating the constraint of mass conservation into the method can significantly increase the accuracy of the retrieved winds and reduce the required frequency of observations for retrieving. },

A set of adjoint equations is constructed to determine the sensitivity of the cost function to initial state errors in those not observed. The initial state variables are then adjusted to minimize those errors. Several experiments are conducted using simulated observations produced by a control run of a dry convection model.

	Abstract = {In this two-part study, a single-Doppler parameter retrieval technique is developed and applied to a real-data case to provide model initial conditions for a short-range prediction of a supercell thunderstorm. The technique consists of the sequential application of a single-Doppler velocity retrieval (SDVR), followed by a variational velocity adjustment, a thermodynamic retrieval, and a moisture specification step. In Part I, the SDVR procedure is described and results from its application to a supercell thunderstorm are presented. In Part II, results from the thermodynamic retrieval and the numerical model prediction for this same case are presented. For comparison, results from parallel sets of experiments using dual-Doppler-derived winds and winds obtained from the simplified velocity retrieval described in Part I are also shown.Following the SDVR, the retrieved wind fields (available only within the storm volume) are blended with a base-state background field obtained from a proximity sounding. The blended fields are then variationally adjusted to preserve anelastic mass conservation and the observed radial velocity. A Gal-Chen type thermodynamic retrieval procedure is then applied to the adjusted wind fields. For all experiments (full retrieval, simplified retrieval, and dual Doppler), the resultant perturbation pressure and potential temperature fields agree qualitatively with expectations for a deep-convective storm. An analysis of the magnitude of the various terms in the vertical momentum equation for both the full retrieval and dual-Doppler experiments indicates a reasonable agreement with predictions from linear theory. In addition, the perturbation pressure and vorticity fields for both the full retrieval and dual-Doppler experiments are in reasonable agreement with linear theory predictions for deep convection in sheared flow.Following a simple moisture specification step, short-range numerical predictions are initiated for both retrieval experiments and the dual-Doppler experiment. In the full single-Doppler retrieval and dual-Doppler cases, the general storm evolution and deviant storm motion are reasonably well predicted for a period of about 35 minutes. In contrast, the storm initialized using the simplified wind retrieval decays too rapidly, indicating that the additional information obtained by the full wind retrieval (primarily low-level polar vorticity) is vital to the success of the numerical prediction. Sensitivity experiments using the initial fields from the full retrieval indicate that the predicted storm evolution is strongly dependent on the initial moisture fields. Overall, the numerical prediction results suggest at least some degree of short-term predictability for this storm and provide an impetus for continued development of single-Doppler retrieval procedures. },

	Abstract = {A variational method for retrieval of the three-dimensional wind field from single-Doppler radar observations is developed and tested. The method uses the conservation equation for reflectivity and the continuity equation as a constraining model. Weak and strong constraint formalisms in data analysis am reviewed and compared using a one-dimensional advection equation for reflectivity considered as a passive tracer. The authors show that a model equation should be used as a weak constraint when the model does not predict exactly the evolution of the observations (such as the conservation equation for reflectivity). Consequently, the variational method presented here combines both formalisms: the conservation equation for reflectivity is used as a weak constraint, while the continuity equation is used as a strong constraint. The method is applied to retrieve detailed three-dimensional wind field of a microburst observed by two C-band Doppler radars during the Phoenix II Convective Boundary Layer Experiment. Retrieved wind fields are compared with dual-Doppler wind analysis. Results of experiments show that the cost function has multiple minima, and consequently retrievals are sensitive to the initial guess. To find the true minimum the retrieval is performed from large to small scale. The results are very encouraging. },

	Abstract = {Summary~~In this paper, a new three-dimensional variational analysis scheme capable of retrieving three-dimensional winds from single Doppler observations of convective storms is developed. The method incorporates, in a single cost function, Doppler radar observations, a background field, smoothness and mass continuity constraints, and the residual of reflectivity or radial velocity conservation. By minimizing this cost function, an analysis with the desired fit to these constraints is obtained in a single procedure. In tests with both simulated and real thunderstorm cases, detailed structures of the storms are well retrieved in comparison with reference analysis.  Unlike most kinematic retrieval methods, our scheme is capable of directly dealing with data voids. When an analysis background is available, say from a proximity sounding, a wind profiler, or a numerical model forecast, the method naturally blends Doppler radar observations with it. Thus, a smooth transition is obtained between data-rich and data-void areas. These features, among others, are important if the analysis is to be used to initialize storm-scale numerical models or for diagnostic studies of storm structures.   },

This approximate model is based on the Lagrangian form of the radial component of the equation of motion and is valid for retrieval time windows that are smaller than the effective timescale of the flow but larger than the product of the effective timescale and (nondimensional) relative error in the radial wind observations. The retrieval was tested with data gathered by two Doppler-on-Wheels mobile Doppler research radars of a cold front on 16 June 2000 near Grandfield, Oklahoma. Experiments focused on the impact of time resolution and the utility of a background constraint obtained from a volume velocity processing (VVP)-like estimate of the wind field. Retrieval error statistics were substantially improved as the volume scan intervals decreased from 5 min {$[$}characterizing the current Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) scan rates{$]$} down to 1 min.

	Abstract = {An identical twin methodology is applied to a three-dimensional cloud model to study the dynamics of adjustment in deep convective storms. The principal goal is to diagnose how mass and velocity fields mutually adjust in order to better understand the relative information content (value) of observations, the physical interdependency among variables, and to help in the design of dynamically consistent analyses to ensure smooth startup of numerical prediction models. Using a control simulation (\&{\#}8220;truth\&{\#}8221; or \&{\#}8220;nature\&{\#}8221; run) of an idealized long-lived bow echo convective system, a series of adjustment experiments is created by resetting, in various combinations, the horizontal and vertical velocity components of the control run to their undisturbed base state values during the mature stage of storm system evolution. The integrations then are continued for comparison against the control. This strategy represents a methodology for studying transient response to an impulsive perturbation in a manner conceptually similar to that used in geostrophic and hydrostatic adjustment. The results indicate that resetting both horizontal velocity components alters the character of the convection and slows considerably the overall storm system evolution. In sharp contrast, when only the vertical velocity component is reset, the model quickly restores both updrafts and downdrafts to nearly their correct (control run) values, producing subsequent storm evolution virtually identical to that of the control run. Other combinations yield results in between these two extremes, with the cross-line velocity component proving to be most important in restoration toward the control run. This behavior is explained by acoustic adjustment of the pressure and velocity fields in direct response to changes in velocity divergence forced by the withdrawal of wind information. },

	Abstract = {Abstract~~A variational method is developed to retrieve winds in the first step and then thermodynamic fields in the second step from Doppler radar observations. In the first step, wind fields are retrieved at two time levels: the beginning and ending times of the data assimilation period, simultaneously from two successive volume scans by using the weak form constraints provided by the mass continuity and vorticity equations. As the retrieved wind fields are expressed by Legendre polynomial expansions at the beginning and ending times, the time tendency term in the vorticity equation can be conveniently formulated, and the retrieved winds can be compared with the radar observed radial winds in the cost function at the precise time and position of each radar beam. In the second step, the perturbation pressure and temperature fields at the middle time are then derived from the retrieved wind fields and the velocity time tendency by using the weak form constraints provided by the three momentum equations. The merits of the new method are demonstrated by numerical experiments with simulated radar observations and compared with the traditional least squares methods which consider neither the precise observation times and positions nor the velocity time tendency. The new method is also applied to real radar data for a heavy rainfall event during the 2001 Meiyu season in China. },

	Abstract = {In this two-part study, a single-Doppler parameter retrieval technique is developed and applied to a real-data case to provide initial conditions for a short-range prediction of a supercell thunderstorm. The technique consists of the sequential application of a single-Doppler velocity retrieval (SDVR), followed by a variational velocity adjustment, a thermodynamic retrieval, and a moisture specification step. By utilizing a sequence of retrievals in this manner, some of the difficulties associated with full-model adjoints (possible solution nonuniqueness and large computational expense) can be circumvented. In Part I, the SDVR procedure and present results from its application to a deep-convective storm are discussed. Part II focuses on the thermodynamic retrieval and subsequent numerical prediction.For the SDVR, Shapiro's reflectivity conservation-based method is adapted by applying it in a moving reference frame. Verification of the retrieved wind fields against corresponding dual-Doppler analyses indicates that the best skill scores are obtained for a reference frame moving with the mean wind, which effectively reduces the problem to a perturbation retrieval. A decomposition of the retrieved wind field into mean and perturbation components shows that the mean wind accounts for a substantial portion of the total retrieved azimuthal velocity. At low levels, where the retrieval skill scores are especially good, the retrieved perturbation azimuthal velocity is mostly associated with the polar component of vorticity. Missing from the retrieved fields (compared to the dual-Doppler analysis) is most of the low-level azimuthal convergence. Consistent with this result, most of the retrieved updraft is associated with convergence of the perturbation radial velocity, which is calculated from the observed radial velocity and directly used in the wind retrieval. },

The basic formalisms are categorized into three areas: (1) \&{\#}8220;timewise localized\&{\#}8221; formalism, (2) formalism with strong constraint, and (3) formalism with weak constraint. Exact satisfaction of selected prognostic equations were formulated as constraints in the functionals for the first two formalisms.

The third formalism is characterized by the subsidiary condition which requires that the prognostic or diagnostic equations must be approximately satisfied.

In this article, the filtering of cach formalism and the uniqueness of solutions of the Euler equations are discussed for a limit that time and space increments (\&{\#}916;t and \&{\#}916;x) approach zero. The results from the limited case study can be applied, with some modification, for the cases where these increments are finite.

	Abstract = {A unique dataset consisting of high-resolution polarimetric radar measurements and dense rain gauge and disdrometer observations collected in east-central Florida during the summer of 1998 was examined. Comparison of the radar measurements and radar parameters computed from the disdrometer observations supported previous studies, which indicate that oscillating drops in the free atmosphere have more spherical apparent shapes in the mean than equilibrium shapes. Radar\&{\#}8211;disdrometer comparisons improved markedly when using an empirical axis ratio relation developed from observational studies and representing more spherical drop shapes. Fixed-form power-law rainfall estimators for radar reflectivity (ZH), specific differential phase (KDP), specific differential phase\&{\#}8211;differential reflectivity (KDP, ZDR), and radar reflectivity\&{\#}8211;differential reflectivity (ZH, ZDR) were then determined using the disdrometer observations. Relations were produced for both equilibrium shapes and the empirical axis ratios. Polarimetric rainfall estimators based on more spherical shapes gave significantly improved performance. However, the improvement was largely in bias mitigation. Rainfall estimates with the ZH\&{\#}8211;ZDR measurement pair had the highest correlation with rain gauge observations, the smallest range in bias factors from storm to storm, and the smallest root-mean-square error. },

	Abstract = {Some general properties of exponential particle-size distributions are discussed. Especially significant are the corrections to calculated liquid water content, precipitation rate, radar reflectivity, and median volume diameter resulting from truncations of the exponential size spectrum at maximum diameters less than infinity. These properties are used to analyze available snow particle-size distribution data. It is concluded that the equation, ND = N0 exp (\&{\#}8722;\&{\#}923;D), describes the size distribution data for snow adequately. In the equation ND\&{\#}916;D is the concentration of snow particles of melted diameter D to D + \&{\#}923;D, N0 = 2.50 {$\times$} 103 R\&{\#}8722;0.94 {$[$}mm\&{\#}8722;1 m\&{\#}8722;3{$]$}, and \&{\#}923; = 22.9 R\&{\#}8722;0.45 {$[$}cm\&{\#}8722;1{$]$}, where R is the precipitation rate in mm hr\&{\#}8722;1. These expressions for N0 and \&{\#}923; differ from those given by Gunn and Marshall, and have the advantage that analytical manipulation of the size distribution equation yields consistent results.

	Abstract = {The algorithm developed in this paper for ground-based polarimetric radars is derived from those used for the spaceborne rain radar of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission)\&{\#}8212;the so-called rain profiling algorithms. The characteristic of this type of algorithm is to be nonlocal, that is, the full rain profile along the radar beam is derived from the reflectivity profile. However, to be stable such algorithms require an external constraint. In TRMM, the constraint is the total path attenuation derived from the observation of the ocean surface, which is used as a reference target. In the present algorithm, the external constraint is provided by the differential phase shift \&{\#}934;DP between H and V polarizations. This is the reason for calling this new algorithm ZPHI. The inverse model on which ZPHI is based is a set of three power law relationships between A and Ze, KDP and A, and R and A, respectively (A, specific attenuation; Ze, equivalent reflectivity; R, rainfall rate). Each of these relationships is parameterized by a \&{\#}8220;normalized\&{\#}8221; intercept parameter N*0 of the drop size distribution (DSD) such as A = a{$[$}N*0{$]$}1\&{\#}8722;bZbe. In ZPHI, N*0 (retrieved by the algorithm) is assumed constant along the profile. Nevertheless, because ZPHI authorizes a segmentation of the treatment, it can deal with complex situations where two (or several) types of rain with different N*0 occur along the profile (e.g., as convective and stratiform rain). Also ZPHI includes a correction scheme for the backscattering effects that may affect \&{\#}934;DP at X and C bands. A series of simulations demonstrate the capability of ZPHI to adjust to the variability of the physical characteristics of the rain (variability of N*0 over two decades, and of the shape parameter \&{\#}956; between 0 and 10), and to operate the rain-rate retrieval with a statistical error similar to that with a \&{\#}8220;classic\&{\#}8221; Z\&{\#}8211;R relationship (when \&{\#}916;\&{\#}934;DP is large enough). The algorithm collapses when the relative error in \&{\#}916;\&{\#}934;DP approaches 58{\%}, which may correspond to an average rain rate of 1.58 mm h\&{\#}8722;1 at C band (1 mm h\&{\#}8722;1 at X band) along an integration path of 50 km. In conclusion, ZPHI possesses all characteristics required in an operational application: mathematical simplicity, robustness, and stability with respect to the measurement noise. It admits a very short dwell time, compatible with scanning velocities of 15{${}^\circ$}\&{\#}8211;20{${}^\circ$} s\&{\#}8722;1. },

	Abstract = {The conventional technique for calibrating Zdr using natural scatterers is based on vertical-looking observations. In some operational weather radar, this method is not applicable because of mechanical constraints that prohibit vertical measurement or choices in the scanning strategies. A technique for calibrating Zdr based on properties of rain returns is proposed and analyzed. The technique is based on an examination of properties of differential reflectivity measurements collected at increasing elevations. Differential reflectivity observed in rain decreases with increasing elevation due to the increasing view angle. Using the hypothesis of uniform microphysical profiles below the bright band, deviations of the profile of differential reflectivity with elevation with respect to the theoretical profile can be used to detect and quantify the presence of a bias on differential reflectivity. To apply this concept in the presence of a nonuniform microphysical profile, the contribution of vertical changes in microphysics to Zdr variation in height is also accounted for. An error parameter associated with the estimated Zdr bias can be used as a quality indicator of the bias estimation; it allows definition of a criterion based on a threshold of root-mean-square error that permits acceptance or rejection of a Zdr bias estimation obtained with the proposed method. The technique is demonstrated using data collected by an operational weather radar at Arpa Piemonte (Italy) and evaluated using independent disdrometer measurement. Results show that under certain conditions discussed in the paper, this method can provide Zdr calibration within an accuracy of 0.1 dB. },

	Abstract = {Using a set of long-term disdrometric data and of actual radar measurements from the McGill S-band operational polarimetric radar, several sources of errors in rain measurement with polarimetric radar are explored in order to investigate their relative importance and the feasibility of a polarimetric technique for estimating R in the context of the McGill S-band operational radar that performs a full volume scan of 24 plan position indicators (PPIs) every 5 min. The sources of errors considered are the variability of drop size distributions (DSDs), observational noise, and systematic variation of the relationships between R and polarimetric parameters at different climate regimes. Additional polarimetric parameters dramatically reduce the effect of the DSD variability on rain estimates by radar. The effectiveness of various multiparameter relationships is investigated. The relationships from the literature that are derived from the DSD model and measured DSDs at a different climate regime differ from those derived from the disdrometric dataset herein. An application of these relationships to the Montreal dataset results in a bias (about 10{\%}\&{\#}8211;20{\%}) and the significant random error resulting from the DSD variability. These errors should be eliminated by using a relationship suitable for the local climate. Assuming a measurement noise as expected from a slow scanning polarimetric radar {$[$}\&{\#}8764;1 rotation per minute (rpm){$]$} and a 10-min smoothing, the R \&{\#}8722; (Zh, ZDR) relationship outperforms the conventional R \&{\#}8722; Zh because of the combined effect of the DSD variability and measurement errors. In addition, the marginal measurement noise that is required to have the same accuracy of R \&{\#}8722; Zh and R \&{\#}8722; (Zh, ZDR) algorithms is obtained as a function of temporal smoothing. The quantified measurement noise of the McGill S-band fast scanning operational radar (\&{\#}8764;6 rpm) is significantly larger than that of a slow scanning radar, implying that a temporal averaging of ZDR of 1 h is needed to achieve some gain with R \&{\#}8722; (Zh, ZDR). },

	Abstract = {A new relationship has been established linking the vertical mean Doppler velocity of raindrop spectra and the accompanying differential reflectivities. It is based upon the specific radar combination of a vertically pointing Doppler and a polarization radar scanning at low elevations, and was derived from consideration of two extensive disdrometer datasets containing 40 000 raindrop-size distributions. Following a detailed error analysis of the new relation, the discussion is directed towards its possible application and limitation. It is shown that under optimum conditions the velocity errors are as low as 0.3 m s\&{\#}8722;1. This results in Doppler radar-derived drop-size distributions having liquid-water contents with uncertainties of only about 40{\%}. Compared to standard particle fall speed estimations of the Rogers' type, this means an improvement in accuracy of more than a factor of three. Although the new technique is not suitable for operational use, it can provide fresh quantitative insight into the vertical structure of the dynamics and the microphysical processes of precipitation. },

	Abstract = {In this paper, the attenuation-correction methodology presented in Part I is applied to radar measurements observed by the multiparameter radar at the X-band wavelength (MP-X) of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), and is evaluated by comparison with scattering simulations using ground-based disdrometer data. Further, effects of attenuation on the estimation of rainfall amounts and drop size distribution parameters are also investigated. The joint variability of the corrected reflectivity and differential reflectivity show good agreement with scattering simulations. In addition, specific attenuation and differential attenuation, which are derived in the correction procedure, show good agreement with scattering simulations. In addition, a composite rainfall-rate algorithm is proposed and evaluated by comparison with eight gauges. The radar-rainfall estimates from the uncorrected (or observed) ZH produce severe underestimation, even at short ranges from the radar and for stratiform rain events. On the contrary, the reflectivity-based rainfall estimates from the attenuation-corrected ZH does not show such severe underestimation and does show better agreement with rain gauge measurements. More accurate rainfall amounts can be obtained from a simple composite algorithm based on specific differential phase KDP, with the R(ZH{\_}cor) estimates being used for low rainfall rates (KDP \&{\#}8804; 0.3{${}^\circ$} km\&{\#}8722;1 or ZH{\_}cor \&{\#}8804; 35 dBZ). This improvement in accuracy of rainfall estimation based on KDP is a result of the insensitivity of the rainfall algorithm to natural variations of drop size distributions (DSDs). The ZH, ZDR, and KDP data are also used to infer the parameters (median volume diameter D0 and normalized intercept parameter Nw) of a normalized gamma DSD. The retrieval of D0 and Nw from the corrected radar data show good agreement with those from disdrometer data in terms of the respective relative frequency histograms. The results of this study demonstrate that high-quality hydrometeorological information on rain events such as rainfall amounts and DSDs can be derived from X-band polarimetric radars. },

	Abstract = {In this two-part paper, a correction for rain attenuation of radar reflectivity (ZH) and differential reflectivity (ZDR) at the X-band wavelength is presented. The correction algorithm that is used is based on the self-consistent method with constraints proposed by Bringi et al., which was originally developed and evaluated for C-band polarimetric radar data. The self-consistent method is modified for the X-band frequency and is applied to radar measurements made with the multiparameter radar at the X-band wavelength (MP-X) operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) in Japan. In this paper, characteristic properties of relations among polarimetric variables, such as AH\&{\#}8211;KDP, ADP\&{\#}8211;AH, AH\&{\#}8211;ZH, and ZDR\&{\#}8211;ZH, that are required in the correction methodology are presented for the frequency of the MP-X radar (9.375 GHz), based on scattering simulations using drop spectra measured by disdrometers at the surface. The scattering simulations were performed under conditions of three different temperatures and three different relations for drop shapes, in order to consider variability of polarimetric variables for these conditions. For the X-band wavelength, the AH\&{\#}8211;KDP and ADP\&{\#}8211;AH relations can be assumed to be nearly linear. The coefficient \&{\#}945; of the AH\&{\#}8211;KDP relation varies over a wide range from 0.139 to 0.335 dB ({${}^\circ$})\&{\#}8722;1 with a mean value of 0.254 dB ({${}^\circ$})\&{\#}8722;1. The coefficient \&{\#}947; of the ADP\&{\#}8211;AH relation varies from 0.114 to 0.174, with a mean value of 0.139. The exponent b of the AH\&{\#}8211;ZH relation does not depend on drop shapes and is almost constant for a given temperature (about 0.78 at the temperature of 15{${}^\circ$}C). The ZDR\&{\#}8211;ZH relation depends primarily on drop shape, and does not vary with temperature. },

	Abstract = {The kinematic structure and reflectivity distribution within a region of widespread precipitation associated with a summertime midlatitude (Illinois) squall line, as revealed by an analysis of Doppler radar data, are presented and discussed. The squall line moved in a southeasterly direction while active convection forming on its leading edge moved in a northeasterly direction. Decaying thunderstorms and their anvils merged to form the extensive region of stratiform precipitation which trailed the squall line. An extension of the VAD (Velocity Azimuth Display) method, or the EVAD (Extended VAD) method, has been developed for the analysis of single-Doppler radar data. In contrast to the VAD method, which requires knowledge of the particle fall velocities (or assumptions regarding it) to calculate the divergence of the horizontal wind, the EVAD method yields the vertical distributions of both the particle fall speed and the divergence. Also presented are results from a multiple-Doppler (MDOP) analysis of data from three radars. A function-fitting technique has been used for the MDOP analysis which filters out motions of high wavenumbers and yields the mesoscale motions. The MDOP method yields the horizontal distributions of the winds, their divergence and the vertical air velocity, while the EVAD method yields their horizontal averages. The EVAD method gave weak (<10 cm s\&{\#}8722;1) ascending air motion below about 1-km height, descent (peak magnitude about 25 cm s\&{\#}8722;1) between approximately 1 and 5-km height and ascent (peak approximately 35 cm s\&{\#}8722;1) above 5-km height. The vertical air velocity calculated by the MDOP method also shows ascent below about 1-km height. Above that height, the MDOP method gave descending motion in the eastern part of the trailing anvil (adjacent to and behind the squall line convection), coinciding with a region of low and dissipating reflectivities. Further to the rear, in the western part of the anvil, the vertical air motion calculated by the MDOP method is qualitatively similar to that found by the EVAD method. It is speculated that the descending motion in the eastern part of the trailing anvil may be part of the subsidence associated with a new line of convection which formed ahead of the old line as it dissipated. The divergence field calculated by the MDOP method shows a banded structure especially pronounced at the middle and higher levels. The component of the horizontal wind relative to the squall line and transverse to it, calculated by the MDOP method, suggests the following: above approximately 3-km height, air entered the trailing anvil at its front and ascended towards its rear; at heights between approximately 3 and 6.5 km, environmental air entered the rear of the anvil and descended towards its front in a height interval from near the ground to 3 km; below the latter flow regime, the air moved from the front to the back of the anvil in a layer whose thickness increased towards the rear of the anvil. },

Several methods, previously proposed, were found to produce estimates that were biased or whose variances were too large.

	Abstract = {A method for the analysis of single-Doppler radar data called band-velocity-processing (BVP) is presented. The BVP method was designed to exploit the two-dimensional nature of banded precipitation systems with crossband length scales of 5\&{\#}8211;50 km. The BVP method offers improved horizontal (crossband) resolution over existing volume scan methods (VAD/VVP), plus the ability to extract band-perpendicular vertical cross sections from a single volume scan. The BVP analysis yields a more complete kinematic structure than RHI analyses, providing estimates for both horizontal wind components, both horizontal divergence components, the shearing deformation, and the vertical shear vector. The bias and variance errors for the BVP method are shown to be acceptably small. The application of the BVP method to a narrow cold frontal rainband reveals several important kinematic features. The mesoscale structure of the low-level jet ahead of the narrow cold frontal rainband is examined. The band relative flow field exhibits a closed helical circulation cell at the front of the band. },

	Abstract = {Vertical motion profiles can be diagnosed with the mass continuity equation using horizontal divergence fields derived from various single-Doppler radar techniques such as EVAD (extended velocity-azimuth display), CEVAD (concurrent extended velocity-azimuth display), and VVP (volume velocity processing). These methods allow for the retrieval of mesoscale air motions in precipitating regions when the wind field is relatively homogeneous. In contrast, VHF wind profiler data can provide a direct measurement of vertical motion, albeit across a much smaller domain compared to the single-Doppler radar techniques. In this study, we compare horizontal divergence and vertical motion patterns derived from the various single-Doppler methods with those obtained from VHF profiler data. The diagnosed profiles of horizontal divergence and vertical velocity from the single-Doppler (scanning radar) techniques are in qualitative agreement in the lower troposphere but often exhibit large variability at higher levels. Because of less stringent radar echo requirements, the VVP technique often analyzed data above the top of the EVAD-CEVAD analysis domain, resulting in a deeper layer of upper-level divergence. The CEVAD technique often produced a deeper and larger region of upward motion despite similar profiles of divergence, probably due to the CEVAD top boundary condition specification of particle terminal fall speed as opposed to the vertical air motion, as well as to the adjustment procedure employed during the regression solution. The wind profiler data showed much larger vertical gradients and magnitudes of divergence and vertical velocity when averaged over the same time interval required to collect data for a single-Doppler retrieval. However, when all the available data were composited, the high-frequency variability in the wind profiler retrievals was reduced resulting in relatively good agreement between all analysis methods. The wind profiler usually sampled vertical motion (divergence) several kilometers above the single-Doppler retrievals, which the authors attribute to the stringent precipitation echo coverage requirements imposed by the scanning radar analysis techniques, thus limiting their vertical extent new echo top. },

	Abstract = {A diagnostic analysis of the VVP (volume velocity processing) retrieval method is presented, with emphasis on understanding the technique as a linear, multivariate regression. Similarities and differences to the velocity\&{\#}8211;azimuth display and extended velocity\&{\#}8211;azimuth display retrieval techniques are discussed, using this framework. Conventional regression diagnostics are then employed to quantitatively determine situations in which the VVP technique is likely to fail. An algorithm for preparation and analysis of a robust VVP retrieval is developed and applied to synthetic and actual datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution. A fundamental (but quantifiable) limitation to some forms of VVP analysis is inadequate sampling dispersion in the n space of the multivariate regression, manifest as a collinearity between the basis functions of some fitted parameters. Such collinearity may be present either in the definition of these basis functions or in their realization in a given sampling configuration. This nonorthogonality may cause numerical instability, variance inflation (decrease in robustness), and increased sensitivity to bias from neglected wind components. It is shown that these effects prevent the application of VVP to small azimuthal sectors of data. The behavior of the VVP regression is further diagnosed over a wide range of sampling constraints, and reasonable sector limits are established. },

	Abstract = {In this study, 600 h of vertically pointing X-band radar data and 50 h of UHF boundary layer wind profiler data were processed and analyzed to characterize quantitatively the structure and the causes of the radar signature from melting precipitation. Five classes of vertical profiles of reflectivity in rain were identified, with three of them having precipitation undergoing a transition between the solid and liquid phase. Only one of them, albeit the most common, showed a radar brightband signature. In-depth study of the bright band and its dependence on precipitation intensity reveals that the ratio of the brightband peak reflectivity to the rainfall reflectivity is constant at 8 dB below 0.5 mm h\&{\#}8722;1 and then increases to reach 13 dB at 2.5 mm h\&{\#}8722;1 and 16 dB at 5 mm h\&{\#}8722;1. The equivalent reflectivity factor of snow just above the melting layer is on average 1\&{\#}8211;2 dB below the reflectivity of rain just below the melting layer, independent of precipitation intensity. The classical brightband explanation accounts for less than half of the observed reflectivity enhancement; the difference could be explained by effects associated with the shape and density of melting snowflakes and, to a smaller extent, by precipitation growth in the melting layer and aggregation in the early stages of the melting followed by breakup in the final stages. The brightband statistics were also significantly different for reflectivities in rain above 2.5 dBZ when observations were made with an X-band radar as opposed to the wind profiler because of the combination of attenuation in the melting layer and the fact that scattering from some of the large hydrometers above and within the melting layer depart from the Rayleigh approximation usually used to compute reflectivity. The bright band is often capped by a thin and faint dark layer, which tends to be more evident at weak precipitation intensifies. },

The range and height dependence of single-Doppler data contains information on the nonlinearity of the wind field and allows a generalized analysis by which vertical profiles of wind, divergence, and deformation at the radar site can in principle be obtained. These ideas are illustrated by two case analyses of single-Doppler observations in clear air. },
